## 4. Notes for Implementation

- **Each transaction entity** should reference master entities for validation and integration.
- **APIs and workflows** should be designed to support these data flows and dependencies.
- **MIS and dashboards** should aggregate and visualize data across modules, supporting decision-making.

---

## 5. Extending This Map

- Specify entity-level links for more granular processes if needed.
- Use this as a blueprint for database schema, workflow engines, and integration middleware.
